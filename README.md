# RW-ToolBox
BepInEx plugin for Rain World designed to help modders debug creature sprites, body chunks, and room tiles
**WARNING:** unless you have a monster of a PC, this will massively impact your game, and not for the better.
Because of the immense number of sprites involved in mapping every tile in a room, your FPS will take a hit.
This is less noticeable in single screen rooms, but even monk/survivor's 3-screen spawn room had my game running at about 15fps.

***If you're not actively using these utilities, disable the plugin completely***

## Controls
**Hyphen/minus key (`-`)** : creature sprite tagger
**Equals key (`=`)** : body chunk tagger
**Del/Delete Key** : tile mapper - places a square sprite on each Room.Tile in the room
