# RW-ToolBox
BepInEx plugin for Rain World designed to help modders debug creature sprites, body chunks, and room tiles

Due to the use of tile grid lines instead of tile node markers, performance impact appears to now be unnoticeable, so the warning that was here before can be disregarded.

## Controls
**Hyphen/minus key (`-`)** : toggle creature sprite tagger

**Equals key (`=`)** : toggle body chunk tagger

**Del/Delete Key** : toggle tile grid
